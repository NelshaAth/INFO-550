# INFO-550 Repo for coursework for INFO 550 - Data Science Toolkit 

Hi! For assignment 3, I analyzed data files from two different air pollutions samplers (units 91 and 96) to test if they were both fully functioning. 
To analyze the data you will need to have three R packages installed: tidyverse, lubridate, and stringi.

To run the script, from the project folder you can run:

Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('Homework_3_Nelsha.Rmd')" which will hopefully create a file called report.html output in your directory that contains the results.
